# python-programs
Trying out a few python programs for practice and learning.

**test_all.py**: this file has all the tests.
To run the tests, just run `pytest` on the command line.

Eg: 

    python-programs git:(master) âœ— pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux2 -- Python 2.7.12, pytest-3.0.5, py-1.4.31, pluggy-0.4.0
    rootdir: /media/vishnunarang/Work/VishnuDOCS/projects/python-programs, inifile: 
    collected 4 items 

    test_all.py ....

    ================= 4 passed in 0.05 seconds ==============================
    
If you have any suggestions or edits/improvements, I would like to hear those. Hope to learn a lot.
